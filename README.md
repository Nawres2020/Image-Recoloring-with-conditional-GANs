# Image-Recoloring-with-conditional-GANs


🔍 Abstract: Image recolorization, a captivating challenge in image translation, has been the focus of our groundbreaking research. Our study introduces and compares three innovative models built upon the Pix2Pix framework, designed for the task across two color domains: RGB and LAB.

🧠 Our Approach:
1️⃣ The first model follows the original Pix2Pix approach, laying the foundation for our exploration.
2️⃣ Our second model elevates the generator's capabilities by integrating perceptual loss (LPIPS) into the loss function, showcasing improved image quality and diversity.
3️⃣ In our third model, we've reimagined the Pix2Pix architecture and harnessed the power of WGAN loss, albeit with mixed results on realistic image generation.

📊 Evaluation:
Through a comprehensive array of experiments and utilizing diverse metrics including FID, IS, PSNR, MAE, SSIM, and even human evaluations, we've meticulously assessed our models' performances. The model with perceptual loss stands out by producing images with remarkable quality and diversity, as evidenced by IS and FID scores. Notably, Pix2Pix excels in pixel-level accuracy and resemblance to ground truth images.

🌟 Implications and Future Endeavors:
Our findings offer invaluable insights to fellow researchers and practitioners in the fields of image recolorization and image translation. As we celebrate this milestone, we're excited about future avenues for exploration, including investigating other loss functions, architectural variations, and diverse dataset compositions to further enhance the art of image generation.
